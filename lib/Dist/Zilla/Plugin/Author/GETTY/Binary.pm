=head1 DESCRIPTION

One instance per standalone binary of the distribution, added by
C<binary> in L<@Author::GETTY|Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::GETTY> or by a
L<@Author::GETTY::Binary|Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::GETTY::Binary>
subsection. It writes the C<x_binaries> key of F<META.json>, which the binary
release workflow reads. Fails the build when the binary's script is not part of
the distribution.

Right after C<dzil build> it packs the binary with C<pp> as a local check and
runs its C<verify> and C<smoke> commands on it; that needs L<PAR::Packer> in
the C<PATH>, or the environment variable C<DZIL_BINARY_SKIP> set to skip the
check. Before a release it refuses to go on without a
F<.github/workflows/binaries.yml> that calls the binary workflow of
L<Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Author::GETTY>. See the C<Binaries> section there
for the whole binary release.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 binary_name

Name of the binary, required: a letter or digit, then letters, digits, C<.>,
C<_> or C<->. Also the name of the binary in F<META.json>.

=head2 script

Script packed into the binary, required, relative to the distribution root; it
has to be part of the distribution.

=head2 modules

Modules packed in besides what C<pp> finds, each as C<-M>. Repeatable.

=head2 require

Modules that have to be inside the finished binary. Repeatable.

=head2 pp_args

Shell command whose output lines are added to the C<pp> command line.

=head2 verify

Shell command run with the packed binary as its argument. It runs without
C<PERL5LIB> and gets in C<DZIL_BINARY_PERL5LIB> the C<PERL5LIB> under which
C<pp> loaded the distribution's dependencies; in the local check that is the
caller's C<PERL5LIB>, empty without one.

=head2 smoke

Shell command the workflow runs with the binary on a machine without Perl. It
runs without C<PERL5LIB> and without C<DZIL_BINARY_PERL5LIB>, in the local check
too.

=head2 platforms

Platforms to build, default all of C<linux-x86_64>, C<linux-arm64>,
C<macos-arm64>, C<macos-x86_64> and C<windows-x86_64>. Dist-wide, repeatable.

=head2 prepare

Shell command run once per platform before the build. Dist-wide.
